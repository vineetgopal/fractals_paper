\subsection*{Preprocessing suboptimally}

We give a trivial preprocessing which uses a $k$-funnel to merge all lists
together and subsample every $k$th element.  

Show that we can place the elements group-wise in the bins in $O(nk/B)$ transfers
using a Z-order traversal.  Point out that this is asymptotically faster than
merging the $k$ lists.

\subsection*{Finding splitters for small $k$}

$k < \lg^2 n$

In this section, sample every element with probability $1/k$ and we just subdivide any bins
with more than $2(1+\epsilon)k$ elements with a cache-oblivious select algorithm.
The total number of memory transfers is $O(N/B)$ whp, which we get through a Hoeffding
bound.

Show that the number of splitters is $O(n)$ - Chernoff.

\subsection*{Finding splitters for large $k$}

$k \geq \lg ^2 n$

In this section, we use sample sort (randomly select with probability $1/\lg k$ and
then rake exactly $N/k$ evenly spaced samples) and $k$ is large enough that we don't have
to subdivide the bins, yet still get $O(k)$-sized (actually, at most 
$2(1+\epsilon)k$ elements) bins whp.
