\subsection*{Abstract}
In this paper we develop an optimal cache-oblivious data structure that solves the
iterated predecessor problem. Given $k$ static sorted $n$-length lists $L_1 \ldots L_k$
and a query value $q$, the \defn{iterated predecessor query} problem is to find the largest
element in each list which is not greater than $q$.  Our solution to this problem
is called range coalescing and requires at most $O(\log_{B+1} n + k/B)$ memory
transfers on a processor with a cache of $M = \Omega \paren{B}$ blocks of size $B$.
Range coalescing consumes $O(kn)$ space and requires only $O(kn/B)$ memory transfers
to construct with high probability.
