\secput{conclusion}{Future Work}
We have presented an optimal cache oblivious solution for the static 
iterated predecessor query. There are several areas in which this can be extended. 
Range coalescing does not currently support dynamic operations like insert or delete.
It becomes very difficult to maintain the size of the bins without a large overhead.

Range coalescing specifically solves the iterated predecessor problem on $k$ lists, but this does 
not generalize easily to a graph of lists. Fractional cascading achieves an running time of
$O(\lg n + k)$ on a graph query, where $k$ is the length of the traversed path in the graph. 
Applying range coalescing directly to this problem result sin $O(\log_{B+1} n + K)$, 
where $K$ is the total size of the graph. The concepts of range coalescing could 
hopefully be developed to be used as a blackbox for such problems.
